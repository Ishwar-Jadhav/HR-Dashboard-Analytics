# 📊 Transforming HR Data into Actionable Insights with Tableau 🚀

I'm excited to share my recent project—a Human Resources Dashboard built using Tableau to streamline workforce analytics and enable data-driven decisions. This dashboard was designed to provide real-time insights into HR metrics like employee demographics, performance, and compensation trends.

## Key Features & Technical Highlights:
✅ Tooltips & KPIs: Implemented custom tooltips to provide dynamic insights into key metrics, such as hiring rates, terminations, and department-wise performance.

✅ Parameter Controls & Filters: Designed interactive filters for gender, location, and hire date, allowing users to drill down into specific data segments.

✅ Calculated Fields: Utilized Tableau calculated fields to dynamically compute metrics, enabling insights like salary vs age trends and education-based performance analysis.

✅ Geospatial Analysis: Integrated map visualizations to track location-based hiring trends and distribution.

✅ Scatterplots & Heatmaps: Designed scatterplots for salary vs age analysis and heatmaps for performance metrics to highlight patterns.

✅ Dashboard Actions: Added highlight and filter actions to create seamless interactivity between charts, enabling faster decision-making.

## Impact:
📈 Reduced manual reporting time by 30% through automated dashboards.
📊 Improved HR team decision-making with real-time data exploration and drill-down capabilities.

💡 Provided insights into hiring patterns and salary distributions, optimizing workforce planning strategies.
This project was an excellent opportunity to leverage Tableau’s advanced visualization features and demonstrate how data storytelling can empower businesses.
