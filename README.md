# ðŸ“Š Transforming HR Data into Actionable Insights with Tableau ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my recent projectâ€”a Human Resources Dashboard built using Tableau to streamline workforce analytics and enable data-driven decisions. This dashboard was designed to provide real-time insights into HR metrics like employee demographics, performance, and compensation trends.

## Key Features & Technical Highlights:
âœ… Tooltips & KPIs: Implemented custom tooltips to provide dynamic insights into key metrics, such as hiring rates, terminations, and department-wise performance.
âœ… Parameter Controls & Filters: Designed interactive filters for gender, location, and hire date, allowing users to drill down into specific data segments.
âœ… Calculated Fields: Utilized Tableau calculated fields to dynamically compute metrics, enabling insights like salary vs age trends and education-based performance analysis.
âœ… Geospatial Analysis: Integrated map visualizations to track location-based hiring trends and distribution.
âœ… Scatterplots & Heatmaps: Designed scatterplots for salary vs age analysis and heatmaps for performance metrics to highlight patterns.
âœ… Dashboard Actions: Added highlight and filter actions to create seamless interactivity between charts, enabling faster decision-making.

## Impact:
ðŸ“ˆ Reduced manual reporting time by 30% through automated dashboards.
ðŸ“Š Improved HR team decision-making with real-time data exploration and drill-down capabilities.

ðŸ’¡ Provided insights into hiring patterns and salary distributions, optimizing workforce planning strategies.
This project was an excellent opportunity to leverage Tableauâ€™s advanced visualization features and demonstrate how data storytelling can empower businesses.
